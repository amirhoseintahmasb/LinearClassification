# LinearClassification
Implementation four Linear Classification methods;
The Ieast square classification.
Fisher's Linear discrimination method.
Linear Perceptron.
Logistic Regression.

For each method, 80% of data is used for training and then computed Recall, Precision and F1-score...
A summary is prepared, that reports the F1-score for each method versus the hyper-parameter that is responsible for basis functions or features complexity.
